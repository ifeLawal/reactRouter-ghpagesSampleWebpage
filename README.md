# React Router + Gh-pages

This is a sample repo using react, react-router, and gh-pages to run a react
website with multiple pages through github.

Support for figuring out how to use react-router in 2020 came from [this great article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-react-router-include-router-hooks/)
from Free Code Camp by Ibrahima Ndaw. It is definitely recommended to have an
understanding of react before attempting this. You can either [read React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
on the react website or follow [this react
lesson](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react/) on FreeCodeCamp.org.

I used [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-deploy-your-react-app-into-github-pages-b2c96292b18e) on Noteworthy - The Journal Blog by Ishara Malaviarachchi
that provided the steps for loading a react app into github pages and I figured
out using process.env.PUBLIC_URL through [this blog post on connecting gh-pages to react
router](https://medium.com/@Dragonza/react-router-problem-with-gh-pages-c93a5e243819)
to finalize the
full process.

This project was also bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about
[deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.
