# React Router + Gh-pages

This is a sample repo using react, react-router, and gh-pages to run a react
website with multiple pages through github.

Support for figuring out how to use react-router came from [this great article](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-router/)
from CSS-tricks by Brad Westfall. It comes with a [very useful github
repo](https://github.com/bradwestfall/CSS-Tricks-React-Series) that provides
code samples for following along and has insightful notes on the Readme that
help you understand any differences in the code.

I used [this blog post](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-to-deploy-your-react-app-into-github-pages-b2c96292b18e) on Noteworthy - The Journal Blog by Ishara Malaviarachchi
that provided the steps for loading a react app into github pages.
